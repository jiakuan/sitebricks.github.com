# Contributing to Sitebricks

We love user contributions in any form. We strive to provide features that users want while maintaining
our commitment to Sitebricks principles. The easiest way to contribute is to send a message to the
 friendly folk on our [mailing list](http://groups.google.com/group/google-sitebricks).

Alternatively, if you already have concrete source code you wish to contribute, feel free to send
 a pull request to [Dhanji](http://twitter.com/dhanji) at the
  [Sitebricks Github repository](http://github.com/dhanji/sitebricks).

Happy coding!
