{"name":"Sitebricks","tagline":"Instant web services stack","body":"# Developing with Sitebricks\r\nSitebricks is a full stack for building Java web services.\r\n\r\nIt assembles together various well-known libraries for things like dependency injection, servlets, configuration in a simple framework. Essentially, it removes the common headache of figuring out how to wire together an application from scratch while also providing basic design patterns all brought together under a performant, elegant RESTful web services library.\r\n\r\n## Overview\r\n\r\nAt its core, a sitebricks application is:\r\n* [Jetty](http://eclipse.org/jetty) - a thin web server  \r\n* sitebricks-web - a RESTful web framework\r\n\r\nAdditionally, sitebricks includes:\r\n* [Guice](https://code.google.com/p/google-guice) - a lightweight dependency injector from Google\r\n* [Guava](https://code.google.com/p/guava-libraries/) - a collections and utility library from Google</li>\r\n* [Logback](http://logback.qos.ch) - an excellent logging facility\r\n* [Jackson](https://github.com/FasterXML/jackson) - the fastest library for working with JSON\r\n* [JodaTime](http://www.joda.org/joda-time/) - a robust date+time library\r\n* Client - a RESTful webservices client capable of non-blocking IO\r\n* Stats - a statistics and monitoring component\r\n* Config - a simple, type-safe config module that works with YAML, Env vars and Guice\r\n\r\nOur philosophy is that these libraries taken together provide a robust framework for building scalable, performant web services. Furthermore, we provide optional modules for easily integrating various useful external systems:\r\n* Persist - a dead-simple, fast SQL library\r\n* Jedis - an interface to [Redis](http://redis.io)\r\n\r\n## Getting Started\r\nAll you need for the standard sitebricks application is the following snippet in your Maven pom.xml:\r\n```xml\r\n    <dependency>\r\n      <groupId>org.sitebricks</groupId>\r\n      <artifactId>sitebricks-app</artifactId>\r\n      <version>1.0</version>\r\n    </dependency>\r\n```\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
